# Map Review Notes & Set
#   Key - Value structure
#     Look up Value with Key
#     Maps are called dictionaries in Python
#     Set based data structure - keys in map are a set

# Array is a list based data structure/ Maps are set based

# Set - data structure comparable to a list
#   No ordering
#   No repeated elements
#   Maps are set based because there can only be one instance of a given key value within a map
#   keys in a map are a set

#   Using a data structure that employs a hash structure allows us to do look ups in constant time
#   list or a set - linear time
#   stacks or queues let us look up oldest or newest elements immediately
#   priority queues let us find the highest elements quickly
#     other elements require linear time search

# TAKEAWAY: always optimize an answer with "use a hash function"
